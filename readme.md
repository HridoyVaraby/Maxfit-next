Design a modern, multi-page, responsive website for “MAXFIT” – a unisex and family gym located in Sonarpur, Kolkata, India.
This gym is inclusive, community-centered, and focused on fitness for all age groups. The website will be built with React & Next.js and later integrated with Supabase for backend functionality (like memberships, login, etc.).

The design should be bold, modern, energetic, and mobile-friendly, using Indian people in images for cultural relevance.
